# Plurality
This program simulates a plurality election where candidates may be inputted and voters may vote for one inputted candidate until all votes are inputted and the winner is outputted.

### Motivation
This was motivated by Harvard's CS50 and partly includes their distribution code in the "plurality.c" file.

### Usage
Usage: ./plurality [candidate...]
